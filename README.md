# Data science study on Boston Airbnb Data

## Project Motivation

Based on Cross-Industry Standard Process of Data Mining (CRISP-DM), the Boston and Seatle Airbnb datasets were collected and investigated.
Three bisinuess questions were asked and answered:

- What are the most important features to estimate Airbnb rental price?  
- What are the top amenities people needs most?  

## File Description

- A Descriptive Jupyter Notebook

## Results of the analysis

Results and discussion were published on Medium: [EDA and Prediction on Boston AirBNB Data Dataset](https://medium.com/@imhimanshurajonly/eda-and-prediction-on-boston-airbnb-data-dataset-4c227869d500)
   
In this project, I dived into the most recent Airbnb Boston and Seattle dataset and found many interesting phenomenom:
- We established a machine learning model to predict the rental price for Boston.
- We took a look at the feature importance of the trained model and check if they make sense.
- We list all the important amenities to get a better feeling how host can make more money by providing better services to meet customersâ€™ need.
